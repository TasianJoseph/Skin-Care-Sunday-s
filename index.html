                <h2> About Skin Care Sunday's</h2>
                <p> This website is collated by the Code First Girls Janvi, Jehan, Sandra and Tash! We wanted to create this blog because we wanted to share our knolwedge about skin care and elaborate on the natural ways in which this can be achieved by using ingredients you probably buy in your weekly supermarket shop! Additionally, we wanted to create a safe space for young women in particular to explore ways that they can improve the health of their skin. We realise this is especially important because of the effects of pollution and hard water on our skin in the UK! </p>

                <p> If you'd like to find out more about the impact that pollution is having on <strong> your </strong> skin, then <a href= "https://www.garnierusa.com/tips-how-tos/can-pollution-affect-your-skin" style="color: #DE735C">then follow THIS link!</a>
                <p> If you'd like to find out more about how hard water is having an impact on <strong> your</strong> skin, then <a href="http://www.water-rightgroup.com/blog/soft-water-hard-water-effects-skin/" style="color:#D69148"> then follow THIS link!</a>
